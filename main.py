# Truck Routes
# For UI: user passes in the Time, outputs statuses of Mileage, package statuses & info (is it in hub, delivered? etc)
# UI can just be a console application

# ideas for optimizing:
#   you can hold a truck until 9, need to optimize miles NOT time.
#   maybe use a priority queue, first a normal queue for mile optimization, then introduce priorities based
#       upon special requests like time requirements etc????
#   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC5CX8drAtU watch this for ideas on optimization
#   https://youtu.be/v5kaDxG5w30?t=588 also this at this time
#   might want to change hash function to a different type, maybe reference textbook. save optimization like this
#       for after the functionality is complete.
